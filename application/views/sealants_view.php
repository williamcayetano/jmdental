      <h2>Dental Sealants in St. Louis</h2>
      <p>If you are tired of getting food particles stuck in your teeth, or are worried about keeping your child's teeth safe and healthy, you should consider getting a dental sealant in St. Louis. Dental sealants are designed to prevent food from getting lodged in your teeth and are beneficial in protecting the molars of children between the ages of 6 to 14.
        <br /><br />
        If you are interested in getting a dental sealant, Dr. John Martin can recommend the perfect dental sealant for your oral health, and answer any questions that you might have about dental sealants in St. Louis.</p>

        <h2>Who Should Get a Dental Sealant?</h2>
        <p>A dental sealant is a thin, plastic coating that is gently applied to the tops of your teeth to "seal" the crevices of your tooth off from food particles and bacteria. On average, dental sealants last for ten years.
          <br /><br />
          Children are the primary candidates for dental sealants in St. Louis due to the sensitivity of their developing teeth and disposition to developing cavities. A dental sealant can protect a child's molars from becoming damaged by infection or lodged food particles that can be a breeding ground for cavities and gum disease.
          <br /><br />
          Dental sealants can be a good choice for your entire family. Having a dental sealant applied as an adult ensures that your smile is food-free and perfect at all times and if any of your teeth have started to decay, it can be limited with a clear sealant that lets your dentist continually monitor your condition.
