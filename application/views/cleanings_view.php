        Preventative dental care is the best way to avoid cavities, gum disease, and other oral health problems. If you are ready to take control of your oral health and get the smile you've always wanted, Martin Dental & Associates offers customized dental cleanings in St. Louis.
        <br /><br />
        Oral health can vary from person to person. Some people are more susceptible to cavities, while others are predisposed to gum disease and other oral health issues. Customized dental cleanings in St. Louis ensure that your teeth are free of plaque and buildup, and that any cavities or other oral health issues you have are immediately treated.

        <h2>What's Included in a Customized Dental Cleaning?</h2>
        <p>
          Calculus and plaque can build up over time and wear away the enamel on your teeth, which makes you more prone to cavities, gum disease, and other oral health problems. During a customized dental cleaning with Martin Dental's hygienists, your teeth will be thoroughly cleaned and treated with a fluoride treatment.
          <br /><br />
          After cleaning your teeth, a hygienist will search for signs of oral cancer, and check your lips, tongue, throat, and neck for abnormalities. If underlying oral health problems aren't identified and treated, over time, they can worsen and cause other health issues.
          <br /><br />
          You might be thinking, "why do I need to have my teeth professionally cleaned? I brush my teeth every day." While it's essential to brush your teeth every day to remove food particles and drink residue from your teeth, a toothbrush won't effectively remove caked-on plaque and build up.
          <br /><br />
          Dr. Martin's hygienist's use high-tech dental equipment that quickly breaks down plaque and other buildup from your teeth, while protecting the enamel.

        <h2>Why Should I Get a Customized Dental Cleaning?</h2>
