      <h2>Porcelain Bridges in St. Louis</h2>
      <p>
        Are you missing teeth because of an accident or gum disease? You could be the perfect candidate for porcelain bridges in St. Louis. Porcelain bridges are dental restorations that take the place of your missing or damaged teeth so that you can be proud of your smile.
        <br /><br />
        There are several materials that dental bridges can be made of, but the most-trusted material is porcelain. Porcelain bridges are made to last if taken care of properly, seamlessly replicate the look of natural teeth, and can enhance your overall oral health.
        <br /><br />
        If you are ready to rediscover your dazzling smile and confidence, Dr. John Martin & Associates offers top of the line, high-quality porcelain bridges in St. Louis.

        <h2>Types of Dental Bridges</h2>
        <p>
          Porcelain bridges are the perfect way to restore your damaged or imperfect smile. Dental bridges are designed to replace your missing teeth and prevent them from drifting and crowding which can damage or shift your existing teeth over time.
          <br /><br />
          If you are missing teeth and are interested in getting back the pristine appearance of your smile, our porcelain bridges in St. Louis are available in a variety of types and styles including:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>Fixed Porcelain Bridges - permanent dental restorations that can only be removed by a dentist, but are durable and long-lasting if taken care of</li>
            <li>Traditional Dental Bridge - traditional dental bridges involve creating a crown for the tooth or two implants that sit on either side of the gap, generally on a ceramic or metal insert, to naturally restore the look of your smile; this is the most common style of bridge</li>
            <li>Cantilever Bridge - a cantilever bridge, while uncommon, can be used when there are teeth adjacent to a missing tooth or gap</li>
            <li>Maryland Bridge - Maryland bridges, also known as resin-bonded bridges, are generally affixed to a porcelain insert and have wings on at least one side that are permanently bonded to your existing teeth</li>
          </ul>
          <br /><br />
          If you are missing one tooth or an entire section of teeth, this can negatively affect many areas of your life. An imperfect smile can cause anxiety about smiling and make it difficult for you to perform everyday functions such as eating, drinking, and even talking.
          <br /><br />
          If you are unsure whether a porcelain dental bridge is the right fit for you or don't know what style would work best for you, Dr. Martin can assess your oral health, take into account your day to day routine, and recommend the perfect porcelain bridge for you based on your oral history and lifestyle.
