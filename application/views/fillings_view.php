      <h2>Tooth-Colored Fillings in St. Louis</h2>
      <p>
        Fillings are one of the most common dental procedures. Tooth-colored fillings can be easily altered to match the color of your natural teeth, are highly resistant to staining, and can last for years to come if taken care of properly.
        <br /><br />
        If you suspect that you have a cavity or are unhappy with the appearance of your existing gold or silver fillings, Dr. John Martin can alleviate the discomfort you are feeling and mend your damaged or decayed teeth with lustrous tooth-colored fillings so that you are confident about your smile.

        <h2>Advantages of Tooth-Colored Fillings</h2>
        <p>
          Tooth-colored fillings can be easily adapted to match a patient's existing tooth color, generally only take one to two sessions to place, and can last for a lifetime if taken care of properly. If you are unsure whether tooth-colored fillings are the right choice for your smile, tooth-colored fillings are the industry standard for the top dentists in Missouri, including Dr. John Martin.
          <br /><br />
          Tooth-colored fillings are strong, durable, and stain-resistant, which means that you'll likely save money, not have to have touch-ups done as often, and can be confident that with proper care, your tooth-colored fillings could last for years to come.
          <br /><br />
          Unlike metal, composite-resin fillings or tooth-colored fillings can be securely bonded to your tooth's structure, which significantly decreases the chances of your filling coming loose, becoming worn down, or causing other complications. While you can pay any dentist to fix your cavity, John Martin & Associates are committed to providing the utmost level of care to their patients and making sure that you are satisfied with their tooth-colored filling services in St. Louis.
