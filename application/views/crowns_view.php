      <h2>Porcelain Crowns in St. Louis</h2>
      <p>
        Porcelain crowns are caps that are placed over damaged teeth to protect them from further damage, improve the appearance of patients' smiles, and extend the life of a damaged tooth for as long as possible. There are a variety of materials that crowns can be made of, but porcelain is preferred as it can easily be matched to the color of a patient's existing teeth.
        <br /><br />
        If you are unhappy with your discolored teeth or tired of dealing with a damaged tooth, Martin Dental & Associates is the leading choice for porcelain crowns in St. Louis and is dedicated to making sure that you are happy and confident about your smile.

        <h2>When is a Dental Crown Needed?</h2>
        <p>
          Porcelain crowns can shield damaged teeth from pain, prevent further damage from occurring, and restore the appearance of your radiant smile. While crowns are not the cheapest option, they are the most commonly chosen option due to their durability, natural look and feel.
          <br /><br />
          If you are unsure if you are a good candidate for porcelain crowns in St. Louis, Dr. Martin can assess your situation and provide you with options for improving the appearance and quality of your smile. The following are some of the most common situations where a dental crown is needed:
          <br /><br />
          <ul>
            <li>If you experience unbearable pain when eating or drinking because of a damaged or decayed tooth</li>
            <li>If you have a tooth that is worn down</li>
            <li>If you have severely discolored teeth that you are unhappy with</li>
            <li>To hold a dental bridge in place</li>
            <li>If a child is at high risk for tooth decay, a dental crown can protect a child's teeth</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>What Type of Porcelain Crowns Are Available?</h2>
        <p>
          While dental crowns can be made from many different materials in various styles, there are two types of porcelain crowns available: porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns and all-porcelain crowns.
          <br /><br />
          All-porcelain crowns have a more natural look than porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns and are great for people with metal allergies, but porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns are generally more durable and with proper care can last for years.
          <br /><br />
          Porcelain crowns, regardless of type, come in three styles: traditional, onlay, and inlay. Onlay and inlay porcelain crowns only cover part of a tooth and are best suited for teeth that are slightly discolored, damaged, or decayed, whereas traditional crowns cover a patient's entire tooth and are recommended for severely damaged, decayed, or discolored teeth.
