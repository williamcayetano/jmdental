      <h2>Dentures in St. Louis</h2>
      <p>
        If you are missing teeth, dentures can improve the overall health and appearance of your smile. Generally, they are made out of porcelain or plastic and molded to fit the exact shape of your teeth for the best possible fit.

        <h2>Types of Dentures</h2>
        <p>
          Whether you are missing a couple of teeth or an entire section of your smile, dentures can restore its natural beauty in no time.
          <br /><br />
          Partial dentures are best suited for patients that are missing two or more teeth, typically impermanent, and on a metal framework, while full dentures are designed for patients that are missing most of their teeth, or who have severely damaged teeth, and can be permanent or impermanent.
          <br /><br />
          A common style of dentures in St. Louis are implant-based dentures that are anchored by metal implants and topped with natural-looking crowns that imitate the appearance of natural teeth.
          <br /><br />
          Choosing the right style of dentures can be overwhelming, but during your initial consultation, Dr. John Martin will assess your oral health and history and ensure that the right dentures are selected to suit your needs.
        </p>
        <h2>How Can Dentures Improve My Oral Health?</h2>
        <p>
          If you have suffered from gum disease or tooth decay, dentures can significantly improve the look and feel of your smile and keep existing teeth from shifting and crowding in your mouth.
          <br /><br />
          A common dilemma of those that have lost three or more teeth is dealing with sagging and weak facial muscles that can make them look older and be uncomfortable when smiling. Dentures in St. Louis offer support to facial muscles and protect a patient's jaw bone.
          <br /><br />
          It's important to keep in mind that even if you have dentures, it's crucial to practice excellent oral hygiene and follow denture care instructions to a tee. If dentures aren't taken care of, they can stain like natural teeth, accrue buildup and plaque, and become damaged.
        </p>
